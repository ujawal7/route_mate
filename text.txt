# React & Router both are library of JavaScript

#create react app
 npx create-react-app .

#Install react router dom for routing the components so we don't have to reload whole page
 npm install react-router-dom@6

# 'a' tag we will not use in place of 'a' tag we will use 'link' & 'navlink' because a tag will refresh the
  all content present in page 
  <a href="/">Home</a>    ==> in html we use like this a tag
  <Link to = '/'>Home</Link> ==> in react router we use like this Link tag
  <NavLink to="/products" className='link'>Products</NavLink>

# 'a' tag we will use to send to different website like for example 
   if we want to send to our facebook page we will use this 'a' tag in react

# Hook 'useNavigate' is used for moving contents in diffrent pages like from product to home etc.

# "Navigate" is used for navigating in route level with conditon like "/admin" this is the the route we can give
    <Route path="/admin" element={<Navigate to = "/products" />}></Route>   
    on /admin it will go to /products
# useParams
 It is used to access the data from database on route level itself

#useSearchParams
 similar to useParams we have useSearchParams which is used for accessing all types of other parameters 
 like if any question mark is there or any search query is there


#Structure of our Project :-

    Create Folder "Components" & "Pages" or in pages we can create more folders like "Contact" and so on we 
    also create a route folder and file to keep all routes

    In route Folder :-
        AllRoutes.js

    In Component Folder :-
        Header.Js
        Footer.Js

    In Pages Folder :-
        Admin.Js
        Home.Js
        ProductList.Js
        ProductDetail.Js
        PageNotFound.Js
        Contact Folder :-
            Contact.Js
            ContactIn.Js
            ContactEu.Js
            ContactUs.Js

    In each folder we can create a index.js file and export all components or pages 
    from that and import everything in one line like this

    in index.js
    export { Header } from "./Header"
    export { Footer } from "./Footer"

    App.js
    import { Header, Footer } from "./components/index";

    In route folder we can have all routes and import it in App.js

#In every page not on components add main in jsx

# We things used from react-router-dom

    Route, 
    Navigate
    useSearchParams, 
    useLocation
